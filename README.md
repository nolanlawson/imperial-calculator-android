Overview
-----------------


Android PhoneGap port of the Imperial Score Calculator app.

The app can be downloaded from [the Google Play Store][3].

There's also a companion web version hosted [here][2].

The HTML5 source code is [here][4].

Build it Yourself
-------------------

The build script ```build_cleanly.sh``` assumes you have the HTML5 source code checked out into a sibling directory.
It cleanly copies in the HTML/JS/CSS/image files, prepares everything for PhoneGap, builds and deploys to any
ADB-connected Android device, then cleans up after itself.
